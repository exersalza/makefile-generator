# Makefile "generator"
We don't generate makefiles here, but we copy them.

### Why you may ask?
Because I'm lazy to write/copy makefiles everytime when I start a new Project what happens quite frequently in the past weeks.

### Installation
There's nothing to compile so you can just put `make install` in the directory.

you can also uninstall it again with `make uninstall`.

also updating works with `make update`.

### Usage
Now the fun part.

Syntax: `mkmf <Lang>` in Lang you can put all supportet.
To know which languages are supportet you can use `mkmf -l` to list them all.
